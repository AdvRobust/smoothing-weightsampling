# smoothing-weightsampling
This repository contains code for the paper **Practical Certified Adversarial Robustness via Weighted Sampling**


# Outline

The contents of this repository are as follows:

- [code/](https://github.com/AdvRobust/smoothing-weightsampling/tree/master/code) contains the code for our experiments

- [results/](https://github.com/AdvRobust/smoothing-weightsampling/tree/master/results) contains the raw data from our experiments

- [figures/](https://github.com/AdvRobust/smoothing-weightsampling/tree/master/figures/mnist) contains the plots that are shown in our experiments

We further provide an example of how to run our code, and checkpoints for MNIST can be downloaded from [Here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArfDZDT3m0qHg07qkCQaGxkS06qx?e=GbzB2m)
